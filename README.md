# VXVault filter (unofficial)
A uBlock Origin compatable filter created from VXVault's URL list

### What is VXVault filter & why does it exist?
VXVault filter takes the [raw list](http://vxvault.net/URL_List.php) of new Malware URLs generated by VXVault - which can not be used in uBo -  and transforms it into a list complatable for uBlock Origin. All credit goes to vxvault.net for the original list.<br>
