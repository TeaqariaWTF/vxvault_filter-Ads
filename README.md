# vxvault_filter
A uBlock Origin compatable filter created from VXVault's URL list

### What is VXVault filter & why does it exist?
VXVault filter takes the [raw list](http://vxvault.net/URL_List.php) of new Malware URLS generated by VXVault, and transforms them into a list complatable for uBlock Origin.<br>
The reason I created this list is because the url list is not compatible with uBo, and thus can't be used in it
